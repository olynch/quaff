# Sample Stat Ideas
#Basic Stats --> determine the "die type" used in different situations, d4 through d12

#These stats will include the basic STR DEX CON INT, more to be decided depending

#These might be filtered through a second level of stat --> this determines how many dice are rolled in each situation

#small numbers might be the way to go, where every roll succeeds if below a certain number --> this way, all dice have a change
 of succeeding, while if trying to reach a high number dice become useless. This way all die types have a chance to succeed.

#First Option for stat meanings --> tabletop based, probably allows for more open ended skills

#subcategories will include things like athletics, acrobatics, investigation -- could be left up to specific campaigns

#with a get less than number style of rolling, these will subtract a certain number of dice from the die pool being rolled, meaning the
 the player is more likely to achieve a successful role.


#Second Option for stat meanings --> more videogame based than tabletop based

#STR -> Physical damage based, matters when you hit, not when trying to hit

#ACCURACY -> Physical damage accuracy, could be focused on being percentage based -> calculate different factors

#CON -> hitpoints as usual

#INT -> Magic damage based, matters when you hit

#CONCENTRATION -> Magic accuracy... need a synonym for this.

#does missing attacks add tension or just not feel good? - will test (XCOM/Fallout vs action rpg/hack and slash)

#Average dice roll counts to remember per die type::: d4=250 d6=350 d8=450 d10=550 d12=650 large deviation between these,
 will look at this later, might focus less on die type and more on die pool for large pools of dice -- or could be interesting way to
 create "focused" characters. -- partially resolved with "getting below a number" style.

#Sample Player Stats

#"Marcus Marcy-Marc" the human

#Str: d6

#Dex: d6

#Con: d6

#Int: d6

#Cha?: d6

#move speed 8

#hp total 340?

#Skills: 6 points in literacy, 10 points in dancing (replace those with athletics and shit, but you'll always know he just dances)

#Hidden dice roles --> attempting to get below the "dc" - average dc would be 450, d4s should be super rare, with d6s the best dice players can get

#dice system might need rework, am thinking of how to do it

#could be a dice pool of just d6s, different races get one ability to be a "d7"

#Every "natural" ability is a pool of d6s, starting at 100 d6s, every skill point in a specific skill adds 10 to the dice pool, while different "modifiers" remove dice from the dice pool. trying to hit a certain target, 200 for very easy skills, 300 for pretty damn easy skills, 350 for easy skills, 400 for easy-medium skills, 450 for medium skills.

#Every race has one d7 in one "natural" skill subset, humans probably don't, instead get 2 extra skill points per level starting at level 1 (this will need balancing, one of these is definitely better than the other) --- or different races have one d5 and one d7 in two stats, while humans have d6s across the board.

#No classes, only based on what skills and attributes you focus on, sort of PoE maybe
