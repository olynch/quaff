Narrative based game: pool of say 24? abilities, each which applies an effect/has a use, classes are combinations of any 4 of these abilities, decided upon by dm of individual games? so we just give them a pool of sample abilities, and they can figure out what seems interesting and fits their world.
sample abilities:
Cleave: apply "Bleeding" to characters in arc of 4 in front of you
Bash: apply "Stunned" to target character
Frost Snap: apply "Frozen" to target character or object
Inferno: apply "Burning" to target area and all characters in it
Mend: apply "Recover" to target character or object

where each effect does something? so frozen either freezes an object in place/freezes water, or freezes a character in place and stops their turn, stunned stops a characters turn for longer, recover removes effects from a character/object

# Sample Stat Ideas
Basic Stats --> percentage based system

These stats will include the basic STR DEX CON INT, more to be decided depending

These might be filtered through a second level of stat --> this will be small bonuses to the given percentage

small numbers might be the way to go, where every roll succeeds if below a certain number --> this way, all dice have a change
 of succeeding, while if trying to reach a high number dice become useless. This way all die types have a chance to succeed.

# First Option for stat meanings --> tabletop based, probably allows for more open ended skills

subcategories will include things like athletics, acrobatics, investigation -- could be left up to specific campaigns

These provide small flat bonuses depending on how many points in that skill you have (maybe based on the proportion of points if we want to force specialization)


# Second Option for stat meanings --> more videogame based than tabletop based

STR -> Physical damage based, matters when you hit, not when trying to hit

ACCURACY -> Physical damage accuracy, could be focused on being percentage based -> calculate different factors

CON -> hitpoints as usual

INT -> Magic damage based, matters when you hit

CONCENTRATION -> Magic accuracy... need a synonym for this.

does missing attacks add tension or just not feel good? - will test (XCOM/Fallout vs action rpg/hack and slash)

percent chance of failure when attacking is not a case of missing, but chance that the enemy will reposte and damage you in return. For spells you take some damage but cast nevertheless, for ranged maybe you miss depending on balance.

Dice roll standard deviations:

The Central Limit Theorem states that if we have n identically distributed independent variables with mean μ and variance σ^2, their sum will have mean nμ and variance σ^2/n, and as n gets larger their sum will be approximately normal. Using this, I have calculated approximate probabilities of rolling 100 dice and *not* getting exactly the mean value. Note that none of them are above 1%. Lots of dice *is not a good idea*.

d4 = sqrt((((4 - 1 + 1)^2 - 1)/12)/100) = 0.11180
% chance of getting a result not equal to 250 (a result 9 standard deviations away) = 0.0%

d6 = sqrt((((6 - 1 + 1)^2 - 1)/12)/100) = 0.17
% chance of getting a result not equal to 350 (a result 6 standard deviations away) = 0.0%

d8 = sqrt((((8 - 1 + 1)^2 - 1)/12)/100) = 0.23
% chance of getting a result not equal to 450 (a result 4 standard deviations away) = 0.0%

d10 = sqrt((((10 - 1 + 1)^2 - 1)/12)/100) = 0.28
% chance of getting a result not equal to 550 (a result 4 standard deviations away) = 0.0%

d12 = sqrt((((12 - 1 + 1)^2 - 1)/12)/100) = 0.34
% chance of getting a result not equal to 650 (a result 3 standard deviations away) = 0.1%

# Sample Player Stats

"Marcus Marcy-Marc" the human

Str: 18
Dex: 13

Con: 16

Int: 8

Cha?: 12

move speed 8

hp total 340?

Skills: 6 points in literacy, 10 points in dancing (replace those with athletics and shit, but you'll always know he just dances)

# Hidden dice roles --> attempting to get below the "dc" - average dc would be 450, d4s should be super rare, with d6s the best dice players can get

natural skill points dictate the base percentages, each point is worth 5% so 0=0% 1=5% 2=10% ... 18=90% 19=95% 20=100%
"artificial" skill points, unrelated to base attributes, increase the percentage change by some flat bonus.
the percentage of success is lowered depending on the DC of what the player is trying to do (set by DM)
if against another thing with stats, the skills are crosschecked in a table, the flat bonuses from both parties are also applied

No classes, only based on what skills and attributes you focus on, sort of PoE maybe



Basic combat system:

quick melee attack: 2 ticks to complete, must be adjacent- hits 3 squares in arc? 2 + str bonus damage
quick ranged attack: 3 ticks to complete, range of 7 squares 1.5 + dex bonus damage
magic-missile: 4 ticks to complete, range of 8 squares, 2 + mgc bonus damage
fireball: 7 ticks to complete, range of 7 squares, aoe of 9 total squares? 4 + magic bonus damage at center, minus one per aoe out

Ticks should be downtime after casting spell as opposed to uptime before casting spell in order to make sure people can't just move to avoid every attack- this will also simulate mana, powerful spells need more downtime, dodgeable ones will launch projectiles etc
#card drafts

Cleaving Strike
