# Sample Stat Ideas
# Basic Stats --> determine the "die type" used in different situations, d4 through d12
# These stats will include the basic STR DEX CON INT, more to be decided depending
# These might be filtered through a second level of stat --> this determines how many dice are rolled in each situation
# small numbers might be the way to go, where every roll succeeds if below a certain number --> this way, all dice have a change
# of succeeding, while if trying to reach a high number dice become useless. This way all die types have a chance to succeed.

#First Option for stat meanings --> tabletop based, probably allows for more open ended skills
# subcategories will include things like athletics, acrobatics, investigation -- could be left up to specific campaigns
# with a get less than number style of rolling, these will subtract a certain number of dice from the die pool being rolled, meaning the
# the player is more likely to achieve a successful role.


# Second Option for stat meanings --> more videogame based than tabletop based
# STR -> Physical damage based, matters when you hit, not when trying to hit
# ACCURACY -> Physical damage accuracy, could be focused on being percentage based -> calculate different factors
# CON -> hitpoints as usual
# INT -> Magic damage based, matters when you hit
# CONCENTRATION -> Magic accuracy... need a synonym for this.
# does missing attacks add tension or just not feel good? - will test (XCOM/Fallout vs action rpg/hack and slash)

# Average dice roll counts to remember per die type::: d4=250 d6=350 d8=450 d10=550 d12=650 large deviation between these,
# will look at this later, might focus less on die type and more on die pool for large pools of dice -- or could be interesting way to
# create "focused" characters. -- partially resolved with "getting below a number" style.

# Sample Player Stats

# Str: d4
# Dex: d10
# Con: d6
# Int: d12
# Cha?: d12
# move speed 8
# hp total 340?
